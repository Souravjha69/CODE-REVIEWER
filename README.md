Build an **AI-Powered Code Reviewer** using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**! 🚀  
This project leverages artificial intelligence to analyze, review, and suggest improvements for code, enhancing **developer efficiency** and **code quality**.  

---

## 🌟 Features  

- 🧠 **AI Code Analysis** — Detects syntax issues, logic flaws, and optimization opportunities.  
- 💬 **Smart Suggestions** — Provides AI-generated recommendations for cleaner, efficient code.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Review** — Instantly analyze code snippets via an intuitive interface.  
- 📊 **Detailed Reports** — Displays categorized feedback for better understanding.  
- 🧩 **Full-Stack Implementation** — MERN architecture ensures scalability and responsiveness.

## ⚙️ Installation  

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:  

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Souravjha69/ai-code-reviewer.git

# 2️⃣ Move into the project folder
cd ai-code-reviewer

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install

# 4️⃣ Add your environment variables (API keys, MongoDB URI, etc.)
Create a .env file in /server and /client directories

# 5️⃣ Start the development servers
# For backend
cd server
npm start

# For frontend
cd client
npm start

🔑 Environment Variables

In your server/.env file, include:
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=5000

🧠 How It Works
	1.	User pastes or uploads code in the frontend interface.
	2.	Backend sends the code to the AI model for analysis.
	3.	The AI model processes and returns feedback with suggestions.
	4.	The frontend displays categorized results — errors, warnings, and optimization tips.

🚀 Future Enhancements
	•	🧩 Multi-language support (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
	•	💡 Custom AI model fine-tuned for specific frameworks
	•	📈 Integration with GitHub for automatic PR reviews
	•	🛠️ CI/CD pipeline and cloud deployment
